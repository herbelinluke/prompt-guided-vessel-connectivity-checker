Vessel Segmentation Quality Evaluation
Scores (1–10)

COMPLETENESS: 7/10
Some vessels are fully captured, but a few small branches—especially near junctions—are partially missing.

ACCURACY: 8/10
Where vessels are detected, the alignment to the true vessel paths is good. Boundaries follow the vessel centerlines closely, with minimal deviation.

CONNECTIVITY: 6/10
There are clear breaks at several junctions (e.g., the central horizontal vessel appears disconnected between the left and right halves). Some branch points fail to fully connect.

NOISE_LEVEL: 10/10
No false positives are visible. The mask is clean and contains only vessel-like structures.

GAP_SEVERITY: 6/10
Gaps are present at key points—most notably at bifurcations and in the central trunk—indicating missed continuity.

OVERALL_QUALITY: 7/10
SUMMARY

The segmentation captures the main vessel structures with good spatial accuracy and no noise, but suffers from connectivity issues and several small gaps, especially at bifurcations and along the central horizontal vessel. Improving continuity and recovering the missing small segments would raise the overall quality significantly.
