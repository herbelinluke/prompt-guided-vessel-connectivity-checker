BIFURCATION_QUALITY: fair

The major vessels and their bifurcations are generally well-represented, but several small-branch junctions show imperfections.

ISSUES_FOUND

Minor discontinuities at fine branches: Some small capillary-level vessels appear broken or slightly fragmented near bifurcations.

Irregular branch junction geometry: A few branch points show angular or abrupt transitions rather than smooth curving merges.

Thickness inconsistency in child branches: In some areas, the parent vessel tapers too suddenly or unevenly before splitting.

Occasional over-thin vessels: Very thin distal branches sometimes appear narrower than anatomically expected, which can exaggerate bifurcation angles.

LOCATIONS (approximate)

Superior temporal region (upper-right quadrant of the segmentation mask): several small branches show thinning and slight discontinuities.

Inferior nasal region (lower-left quadrant): branching geometry is somewhat angular at several bifurcations.

Near the optic disc: a few primary branching points show mild unevenness in child-branch thickness.

ANATOMICAL_PLAUSIBILITY: yes

Overall, the branching pattern follows realistic retinal vascular topology:

Major arcades are preserved

Vessel hierarchy and tapering trends look natural

No structurally impossible or anatomically implausible bifurcations observed

Minor imperfections appear to be algorithmic artifacts rather than violations of anatomical structure.
