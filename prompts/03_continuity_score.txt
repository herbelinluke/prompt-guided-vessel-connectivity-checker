INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHATGPT:
1. Upload the composite image (shows original + mask + overlay)
2. Copy everything below the dashed line and paste it as your message

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rate the continuity of this vessel segmentation on a scale of 0 to 1.

You are shown:
1. The original retinal/vessel image
2. The binary segmentation mask (white = vessels, black = background)
3. An overlay showing the segmentation on the original image

Consider:
- Are major vessels fully connected from origin to periphery?
- Are there any unexpected breaks in vessel paths?
- Do vessels maintain continuity through crossing points?

Respond with:
CONTINUITY_SCORE: [0.0 to 1.0]
CONFIDENCE: [0.0 to 1.0]
REASONING: [brief explanation]
