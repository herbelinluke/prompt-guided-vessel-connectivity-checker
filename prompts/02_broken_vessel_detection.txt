Examine this vessel segmentation and identify any broken or disconnected segments.

You are shown:
1. The original retinal/vessel image
2. The binary segmentation mask (white = vessels, black = background)
3. An overlay showing the segmentation on the original image

For each broken segment you find, describe:
- The location (e.g., "upper-left quadrant", "near center")
- The type of vessel (major artery, minor vessel, capillary)
- The severity (minor gap, major disconnection)

Format your response as:
BROKEN_SEGMENTS:
1. [location] - [vessel type] - [severity]
2. [location] - [vessel type] - [severity]
...

TOTAL_BREAKS: [number]
SUMMARY: [brief overall assessment]
