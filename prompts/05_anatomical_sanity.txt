PROMPT: Anatomical Sanity Check
DESCRIPTION: Check if segmentation looks biologically realistic (no artifacts)
================================================================================

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHATGPT:
1. Upload the composite image (shows original + mask + overlay)
2. Copy everything below the dashed line and paste it as your message

Evaluate if this vessel segmentation is anatomically plausible.

You are shown:
1. The original retinal/vessel image
2. The binary segmentation mask (white = vessels, black = background)
3. An overlay showing the segmentation on the original image

Check for:
1. Does the vessel tree structure look natural for retinal/vascular anatomy?
2. Are vessels properly connected in a tree-like hierarchy?
3. Are there any floating segments not connected to the main tree?
4. Are there unrealistic loops or crossings?

Provide your assessment:
ANATOMICALLY_PLAUSIBLE: [yes/no]
STRUCTURE_TYPE: [tree-like/network/fragmented]
ISOLATED_SEGMENTS: [none/few/many]
ARTIFACTS_DETECTED: [list any obvious segmentation artifacts]
CONFIDENCE: [0.0 to 1.0]
