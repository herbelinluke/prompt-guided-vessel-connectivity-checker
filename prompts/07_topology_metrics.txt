Analyze the vessel segmentation and estimate the following topology metrics.

You are shown:
1. The original retinal/vessel image
2. The binary segmentation mask (white = vessels, black = background)
3. An overlay showing the segmentation on the original image

Please estimate these metrics by carefully examining the segmentation:

1. CONNECTED_COMPONENTS: How many separate/disconnected vessel networks are there?
   - Count distinct vessel groups that are NOT connected to each other
   - A fully connected network = 1 component
   - Each isolated vessel fragment adds to the count

2. BRANCH_POINTS: Approximately how many branching points (bifurcations/trifurcations)?
   - Count points where vessels split into 2 or more branches
   - Include both major and visible minor branch points

3. END_POINTS: Approximately how many vessel endpoints?
   - Count points where vessels terminate (tips)
   - Include both natural endpoints and endpoints from segmentation cutoffs

4. VESSEL_DENSITY: What percentage of the image area is covered by vessels?
   - Estimate as low (< 5%), medium (5-15%), or high (> 15%)

5. CONNECTIVITY_QUALITY: Overall connectivity quality from 0.0 to 1.0
   - 1.0 = perfectly connected, single continuous network
   - 0.5 = moderately connected, some breaks
   - 0.0 = heavily fragmented, many disconnected pieces

Respond in this EXACT format:

CONNECTED_COMPONENTS: [integer]
BRANCH_POINTS: [integer estimate]
END_POINTS: [integer estimate]
VESSEL_DENSITY: [low/medium/high] ([percentage estimate]%)
CONNECTIVITY_QUALITY: [0.0 to 1.0]
CONFIDENCE: [0.0 to 1.0]
