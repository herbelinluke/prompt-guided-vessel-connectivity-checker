DESCRIPTION: Comprehensive evaluation with 5 separate dimension scores (1-10 each)
================================================================================

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHATGPT:
1. Upload the composite image (shows original + mask + overlay)
2. Copy everything below the dashed line and paste it as your message

Provide an overall quality assessment of this vessel segmentation.

You are shown:
1. The original retinal/vessel image
2. The binary segmentation mask (white = vessels, black = background)
3. An overlay showing the segmentation on the original image

Evaluate:
1. Completeness - Are all visible vessels captured?
2. Accuracy - Does the mask align with actual vessel boundaries?
3. Connectivity - Are vessels properly connected?
4. Noise - Are there false positive segments?
5. Gaps - Are there missing vessel sections?

Score each from 1-10:
COMPLETENESS: [1-10]
ACCURACY: [1-10]
CONNECTIVITY: [1-10]
NOISE_LEVEL: [1-10, where 10 = no noise]
GAP_SEVERITY: [1-10, where 10 = no gaps]

OVERALL_QUALITY: [1-10]
