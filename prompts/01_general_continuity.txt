Analyze this vessel segmentation for connectivity.

You are shown:
1. The original retinal/vessel image
2. The binary segmentation mask (white = vessels, black = background)
3. An overlay showing the segmentation on the original image

Please assess:
- Does the vessel segmentation appear continuous throughout?
- Are there any visible breaks or gaps in the vessel structures?
- Rate the overall connectivity quality from 1-10

Provide your analysis in this format:
CONTINUITY: [continuous/discontinuous]
BREAKS_FOUND: [yes/no]
QUALITY_SCORE: [1-10]
DESCRIPTION: [detailed analysis]
