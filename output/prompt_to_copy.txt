Analyze the vessel bifurcations (branching points) in this segmentation.

You are shown:
1. The original retinal/vessel image
2. The binary segmentation mask (white = vessels, black = background)
3. An overlay showing the segmentation on the original image

A good bifurcation in a vessel segmentation should:
- Show smooth transitions at branch points
- Maintain vessel continuity through the branch
- Have consistent vessel width relative to child branches

Examine the segmentation and report:
BIFURCATION_QUALITY: [good/fair/poor]
ISSUES_FOUND: [list any problems at branch points]
LOCATIONS: [where issues occur, if any]
ANATOMICAL_PLAUSIBILITY: [yes/no - do bifurcations look natural?]
